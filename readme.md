# techstack experiments

A personal repository for all my experiments on various tech stacks.

As the technology stack Keeps increasing at a rapid speed, it's hard to keep a track of the concepts and examples in one place. this repo is organised by separate folders for each of the tech stack. It will also have a separate readme which explains the gotchas and other learning from that stack.

This is not a book or documentation. But contains sample code based on the official tutorial/docs from the respective  tech.
